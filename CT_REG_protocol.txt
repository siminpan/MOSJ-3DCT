CT Image REG:

Segment t and f
Make model for t
Surface toolbox Mirror right t

Surface Registration(under 3D Slicer v.4.10.2, v.4.11 only have Model Registration. Result seems the same)
 for Mirror right t to left t 
        Have transformation_3
Copy volume of right or make labelmap form right t (and f)
Transformation_4 on top left from 1 to -1 (mirror labelmap)
Transform_4 within transformation_3

in Data view harden transform will lock the transformation for good

followed by General registration(BRAINS works better than Elastix) of the volume under transformation_4 under transformation_3
get new Slicer Linear Transformation apply to transformation_3

get model back to siegment(in a new seg hierarchy) and cut to make matching end with the left-t

get model out for both and model to model distance

Model to model distance (signed closet )

fixed: left    VTK Output File_2
and
fixed: right   VTK Output File_3

result is different get both.

use python script for histogram, data output and plot
